      So I'm going to cut to the chase. Method 1 is cutting it out COLD  TURKEY.

    I'm talking deleting all the apps immedietly and not looking back. Now this isn't for everyone but it's certainly a valid route. This is a excerpt from someone who believes this is the only way, though I don't think that is the case, going this route, it should feel like your only way so here you go.

    <p>The evidence shows that social media usage can’t be moderated — it’s simply designed to be excessive. As such, the best solution is a complete cessation of social media. Some may argue that deleting social media deprives humanity of its benefits. I can confidently say that, having deleted my social media in September, this is not the case.
    I keep in touch with old friends through text messages and Marco Polo. When I quit, I also realized that being deprived of my high school classmate’s third cousin’s pictures didn’t really bother me all that much. I get my news online now, and I can get my pop culture fix from E!’s website just as easily as their Instagram account. I have found that I can search trending hashtags in a search engine, and keep up with the latest grassroots movements without logging in and spending an accidental six hours on my account. Any benefit that social media offers, I guarantee that another app can perform the same function, without all of the harms.
    Believe me, if I can do it, it’s possible, people. Make the decision to quit the habit today.
