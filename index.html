  <h2>My Journey</h2>
<div class="methods">
  <p>I was very intentional to make this title my journey because I am nowhere near the destination. I remember being in boarding school where we could not use our phones at all. We stored it away and didn't get it till the end of the semester. We had to use our dorm phone to call our parents so it was very much read your book and go to sleep. I think that created an idolization of the phone. It was this prize that I couldn't wait to see again. So when I switched schools and was finally given full access to my phone I might have gone a lil too wild. Like most people I carried that thing on me at all times, couldn’t and still can't imagine a world without it. Fast forward to when I met my number one foe, at this point, Tik Tok. I actually didn't like Tik Tok when I first heard about it. It seemed like a cult and I had no plan to download. I should have listened to my initial gut reaction. Now I continually am in a cycle of falling on and off the wagon in my addiction to social media. And who knows maybe making this will help me too.

<p>Of course it's good to know the context of these addictions. These company spend time and money finding out the best way to keep us glued to their screens. So the blame isn't all on us but at the end of the day it's your’s(and my) life and we are in control of what we do. This page is to help you gain some insight and tools into how you can break your own addiction.
